# Dice Warrior
 A project in C because I can't find my old Construction Game Project.

Inspired by a mobile game called Dungeon Reels and my frustration with the one-note nature of optimal strategies in Dungeon Reels. Essentially, the game has you loading up a simple slot machine with a variety of cards. Each turn the machine spins and lands on three of your cards. Each card can then be used before the turn ends. So far, pretty much a basic deckbuilder. The kicker comes with jackpots. If all three cards are the same, you get a bonus effect which can be quite strong. This strongly incentivizes players to only take one card over an over again in a given run to maximize their chances of getting jackpots.

The one exception to this optimal strategy comes in the form of buff-payoff builds. In these builds you mostly pick a card that gives you bonuses each time you play it in a fight, such as bonus damage or bonus defense. Then you grab just a few of a payoff card, such as a damage card that heals you based on its damage or a card that deals damage based on your defense. This would add a good bit of depth to the game except there are only a small handful of viable buff cards and an even smaller selection of viable payoff cards.

So the goal for this game is to make a dice builder dungeon crawler with many viable strategies and interesting decisions rather than just retrying until you get a workable build. This game will feature combat like Dungeon Reels, but with dice building mechanics similar to Roll or Rollscape.

A note for the future: upgrades to dice can use a shop system where the character can buy any upgrade they like, but the cost increases when applied to a more upgraded die or die face. Each shop could also have a specialization/weakness causing certain upgrades to be cheaper or more expensive. This would be visible on the shop so that players can plan their route to support their build.
